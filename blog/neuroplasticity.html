          <h3>Research Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>
            Neuro plasticity to begin with is a mash-up of two words: Neural:
            relating to nervous system & Plasticity: the capacity to adapt. It
            refers to the brains ability to change itself. It is the process in
            which the brain forms new neurons and lays down new connections
            between neurons, in response to learning, in order to form a pathway
            to repear the learned behaviour.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
            people. <br />Neuroplasticity is the ability for these connections
            to brain and body to change in response to experience. It is the
            fundamental to learning, memory and recovery from brain injury. It
            plays a huge role in developmental growth. It allows the brain to
            fine-tune connections based on experiences and environmental
            stimuli, shaping cognitive and emotional behaviour. It can help
            motivate pursue personal growth, self-improvement and development.
            It encourages the idea that personal growth and improvement are
            possible at any age given the right tools and environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
            for your benefit. <br />Here are some ways I plan to use
            neuroplasticity in my own learning and career switch.
            <br />Deliberate effort to challenge myself when things get
            difficult. There has been several times during the first 3 weeks
            when I was feeling challenged and felt inadequate during an
            exercise. I have made sure to keep trying take the right breaks to
            divert the mind a little and come back to them. Deliberate and
            diligent actions towards learning something new and growing my
            skills would be something I’d wish to keep doing. <br />Mindful
            activities – after only a couple of weeks going through the core
            content I have realised so much of the core content has actually
            helped me in the tech side. Writing blogs of what I’ve learnt,
            coming up with an analogy of the learning these have helped a lot
            digest the new information and really understand them even more.
            Writing a personal blog and even my personal journal has helped
            gather thoughts and keep myself accountable with my actions so far
            and would be keeping these habits on for a very long time.
            <br />Social interaction – engaging in mindful social interactions.
            Interacting with others is something that has been extremely helpful
            so far. I have been catching up Friday afternoons with a couple of
            people from our homegroup for a coffee and discussions and that has
            helped a lot to learn about their experiences. We discuss learnings,
            things that challenged us, things we wanted to work on. Overall it
            has been very helpful to catchup with someone who is going through
            the same process as myself and being able to relate with their
            experiences. <br />Physical exercise – I have been very motivated to
            be regular with my physical exercise from the beginning of the
            programme. In the past I have never been regular at the gym for more
            than a couple of months but learning that physical exercise can play
            a major role in my overall mood. I treat it as a way to shut down
            and focus on something else for a couple of hours as a break to
            refresh my mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
            <br />After some research and looking at suggestions on how to
            increase neuroplasticity – it seems like we need to challenge our
            brains in learning something new and creative. Something that is
            attention-intense with learning, growing, and changing and should
            get the job done. Here are some suggestions for things to try and
            improve neuroplasticity: learning a new language, travel, learn to
            juggle, make music, mindfulness and meditation, exercise regularly.

            <br />I love listening to podcasts and have listened to Andrew
            Huberman’s podcast in the past. So I jumped to watch the below
            podcast when it came up for neuroplasticity during exploring stage.

          </p>
          <h3>Research Growth Mindset</h3>
          <p>
            Discuss what it is and why it is relevant. <br />It is a way of
            viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset
            believe even if they struggle with a certain skill, theur abilities
            aren’t set in stone. They thing that with work, their skills can
            improve overtime. <br />It is super relevant to the current
            situation while we are all learning new skills and are bound to hit
            a wall in that process. Having growth mindset will help us overcome
            and look past those challenges in a bigger picture and take them as
            a learning experience as opposed to obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
            <br />The ted talk surprised me in many places specially referring
            to the results that kids saw with just seeing not passed yet. Yet
            being the keyword here. It showed them that they still have room to
            improve and it is not the end yet. There is a popular dialogue in an
            Indian movie that comes to mind (I might be paraphrasing here) but
            it goes something like it’s not over until it’s over.
          </p>
          <p>
            How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
            <br />Looking at the bigger picture basically for the journey, I
            guess that’s why they say it’s a journey. Remembering that it’s a
            marathon and not a sprint. Taking a break when things get tough to
            reframe the challenge as a growing opportunity. Reminding myself
            that it is supposed to be difficult whenever I come across a tough
            challenge. Take a break to divert my mind and come back to take a
            stab at it again. Keep trying until it becomes easy and then find
            something else to challenge and repeat the process.
          </p>

            <br />I had seen a ted talk many years ago and I guess it had been
            in my sub-conscious because I remembered what they were talking
            about – marginal adjustments in your day to day life to achieve you
            big life goals. So here it is by marginal adjustments this person
            learned a new language, auto-racing license, flying a helicopter,
            rock climbing etc.
          </p>
          <h3>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h3>
          <p>
            Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence
            your learning plan and strategy. <br />Growth mindset and
            neuroplasticity will be helping me a lot over the duration of the
            programme. Understanding that big ambitious goals are going to be
            achieved with my actions on a day to day basis. I need to set clear
            goals for myself, break them down into clear actionable steps on a
            day-to-day basis and making sure I hold myself accountable to carry
            them out. Stay physically and mentally fit, not only going to the
            gym regularly but also to keep exploring the meditation route as I
            have known many people who have benefited from these tools. I wish
            and will try to connect with peers going through the same process
            and journey as me.
