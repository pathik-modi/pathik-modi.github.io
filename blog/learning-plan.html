              <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
              <p>
                My long-term goal is to own a business that helps solve a
                problem, at the same time something I am passionate about and am
                naturally strong in. <br />To get there I wish to build my
                fundamental technical knowledge and get an in depth
                understanding of the industry and all the moving pieces
              </p>

                learning
              </h3>
              <p>
                Something I do very well is being very thorough in my approach,
                solve problems independently and creatively.
                <br />I struggle with are raising my hand to ask for help, being
                overly critical of my work and needing rational explanations of
                what I am required to do and why.

              <p>
                I would like to be able to work efficiently in a team. As well
                as build and maintain mutually-beneficial relations with
                different stakeholders.

              </h3>
              <p>
                An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
                productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
                industry/community representatives. <br />Something I have kept
                saying to myself in the past is “____ like an athlete” <br />It
                could be study like an athlete or work like an athlete or
                anything else. <br />I plan to do continuous improvements,
                dedicated and disciplined with my efforts. Improving each day
                and competing with myself is something that really motivates me.
                <br />
                <br />What you will do when things are building up and starting
                to get to you <br />Raise my hand and ask for help from the
                facilitator or peers on discord. Putting in the extra hours and
                not stopping until I catchup

              </h3>
              <p>
                I commit to seek help from the facilitators on discord channels.
                I promise to try and find answers to issues myself, search
                online on google to help me solve a problem. Only after spending
                10-15 minutes being stuck will I reach out to the discord
                channels. I will also provide a good background on what the
                issues are and what I have done to solve so far.

              <p>
                I expect the facilitators team to reach out individually or
                within homegroups to organize regular catchups. Help when
                someone sends out a problem they are stuck on. <br />I also
                expect them to challenge us to think about solving issues
                ourselves by providing guidance and advise where needed.

                Nothing planned on my day-to-day. I am 100% committed in being
