              thoughs at different points during the programme. Hopefully they

          <h3><b>Bootcamp Learning Plan</b></h3>
          <br />
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            I hope the skills I’ve learnt at dev academy would equip me to build
            personal projects that are relevant and useful in the real world.
            With these personal projects I’d like to be able to showcase my
            skills to potential employers. To which I’d like to land my first
            role in the IT field explore the vast ocean of information and get
            really technically strong.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d like to get to a point where I’d be capable to solving problems
            through technology, monetize it and influence others to work on that
            common goal with me.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think my strength to work out solutions to problems independently
            and critical thinking have been somewhat consistent throughout the
            foundations. My weakness to raise my hand and ask for help has
            gotten better since the beginning seeing peers do the same in the
            discord channels. Making me want to do the same.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have also realise I would procrastinate on an exercise when I am
            stuck on an issue and will spend a lot longer on a challenge that I
            have solved or know I can solve. In saying that I have managed to
            stay persistent on solving them before moving on by googling to
            understand the concepts further. I do think I have a long way to go
            to learn how and how often to ask for help when I am stuck on
            something.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Asking for help would be a challenge for sure specially because
            during bootcamp I will not have enough time or patience to keep on a
            problem for longer than expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working in groups has been a challenge in the past and think it
            could be the same during bootcamp but something I have been
            constantly and consciously making effort to get better in.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
          <p>
            It would be absolutely amazing to grow my skills around teamwork
            within a group and ultimately my leadership skills. Growing skills
            around actions that are necessary to motivate myself and others
            during tough times and even pushing myself and others to excel in
            day-to-day activities would be great to work on.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
          <p>
            I would love to have weekly or fortnightly catchups with the
            bootcamp team to receive feedback and guidance around developing my
            core and technical skills. These weekly catchups should be 1 on 1
            and as a group.
          </p>
          <p>
            The 1 on 1 catchups would allow deeper and more meaningful
            conversations around where things stand and how they can be improved
            even further. The group catchups we currently do within our
            homegroup have been very good to connect with peers and understand
            how everyone is feeling and usually knowing that everyone is going
            through a very similar experience throughout the week.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
          <p>
            I’d like to take up the bootcamp team on the technical catchups on a
            fortnightly or monthly basis to get feedback on how I am going. To
            come out the bootcamp with skills to figure out and build personal
            projects and demonstrate my skills to potential employers is my
            ultimate next goal from the bootcamp. I’ll make sure to be on top of
            what’s expected and required during each week of the bootcamp. If it
            meant staying for additional practice or more time to solidify my
            understanding around concepts I’ll do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’d love to work on feedback that I receive from the bootcamp team
            as I’d love to be coachable and demonstrate that I am coachable for
            future employers. I’d like to nail down a system for feedback that
            really works for me and even be able to structure any kind of
            feedback and apply that in my day to day.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />

          <h3><b>Foundations Learning Plan</b></h3>
          <br />
          <h3>What is your long-term goal or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            My long-term goal is to own a business that helps solve a problem,
            at the same time something I am passionate about and am naturally
            strong in. <br />To get there I wish to build my fundamental
            technical knowledge and get an in depth understanding of the
            industry and all the moving pieces
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            Something I do very well is being very thorough in my approach,
            solve problems independently and creatively.
            <br />I struggle with are raising my hand to ask for help, being
            overly critical of my work and needing rational explanations of what
            I am required to do and why.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I would like to be able to work efficiently in a team. As well as
            build and maintain mutually-beneficial relations with different
            stakeholders.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:
          </h3>
          <p>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, Facilitators and industry/community
            representatives. <br />Something I have kept saying to myself in the
            past is “____ like an athlete” <br />It could be study like an
            athlete or work like an athlete or anything else. <br />I plan to do
            continuous improvements, dedicated and disciplined with my efforts.
            Improving each day and competing with myself is something that
            really motivates me.
            <br />
            <br />What you will do when things are building up and starting to
            get to you <br />Raise my hand and ask for help from the facilitator
            or peers on discord. Putting in the extra hours and not stopping
            until I catchup
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I commit to seek help from the facilitators on discord channels. I
            promise to try and find answers to issues myself, search online on
            google to help me solve a problem. Only after spending 10-15 minutes
            being stuck will I reach out to the discord channels. I will also
            provide a good background on what the issues are and what I have
            done to solve so far.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            I expect the facilitators team to reach out individually or within
            homegroups to organize regular catchups. Help when someone sends out
            a problem they are stuck on. <br />I also expect them to challenge
            us to think about solving issues ourselves by providing guidance and
            advise where needed.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Nothing planned on my day-to-day. I am 100% committed in being
            successful in this new journey and willing to give whatever it
            takes.
