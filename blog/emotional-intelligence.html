          <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          <p>Emotional Intelligence or EQ in simple terms refers to how well we handle ourselves and our relationships with others.

            ESCI model has 4 major fascets of EQ,
            <ol>
              <li>Self-awareness: It is at the heart of the model and considered as the starting point for developing high EQ. It is the ability to understand our emotions, our drives, strengths and weaknesses. It enables us to understand our emotions overtime, despite setbacks</li>
              <li>Social awareness: Knowing and understanding what others are feeling. Includes having empathy and organizational awareness.</li>
              <li>Self-management: Handling distressing emotions effectively at the same time not ignoring them. In sucessful cases it shows people who can align their passions with actions, having a positive outlook and emotional self-control adaptability.</li>
              <li>Relationship management: This is where our emotional social intelligence become visible to others. It is where we put together all the other aspects in practice. Sucessful people have often shown higher than average ability in this area. Some ways to measure would be efficiency in coaching and mentoring, conflict management, influence, inspirational leadership and teamwork.</li>

          <h3>Why is EQ important?</h3>
          <p>There are several reasons why EQ is important. It has been seen as an essential skill for leadership.
            <br>Leaders set the tone for organizations. if they lack emotional intelligence, it could effect in lower employee engagement and a high turnover rate.
            <br>While IQ is important for technically performing at your role, if you can't effectively communicate with your team or collaborate with others, those technical skills will get overloked.
