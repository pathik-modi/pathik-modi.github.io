              <p>
                I recall one summer holiday when I was 17 - me, my mother and
                brother were supposed to visit dad in our Chinese factory and
                meet him after 6-8 months. An important sales person from our
                Mumbai showroom had unexpectedly left for an extended annual
                leave during the busy months. I remember to volunteer by
                cancelling my summer holidays and stay back to help out. Looking
                back it was not a difficult decision for me as I had seen
                members of my family make similar sacrifices for the collective
                good.
                <br />I was not asked or expected to forgo my summer holidays
                and could have easily let someone else pickup the work but my
                values around showing dedication to the collective good helped
                with my decision.

              <p>
                I belong to a trading community in India. Most of my family &
                ancestors including my parents have been self-employed. I have
                always been encouraged to get involved in the family business.
                That exposure has taught me a lot about hard-work, diligence,
                integrity and putting collective good over self. Years have
                passed and my involvement in the family business has only grown
                until this year when I decided to explore new opportunities.

              <p>
                I have taken “16 personalities test” and it turns out my
                personality type is Architech INTJ-T. Architects are one of the
                rarest personality types - and the most capable. Strengths
                include - being rational, informed, independent, determined &
                creative.
                <br />My strength to stay calm at the face of an overwhelming
                challenge - turning to outside resources to identify common
                themes for a solution will help me tackle new challenges when I
                inevitably find myself in the deep end in my new career.

                Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
                development. How might these affect your learning journey?
              </h3>
              <p>
                Architect personality type can be arrogant, dismissive of
                emotions, overly critical, combative and socially clueless as
                per the “16 personalities” test. After reading on these
                short-comings I can definitely relate and can recall instances
                when I was let down.
                <br />I tend to get bored with mundane repetitive tasks a lot
                and like to look at the big picture and strategise. This has
                been an issue when I am not able to perform tasks that I do not
                see too much value in. I believe this could be an issue for me
                in the initial years of my career as I do not realistically
                expect to be in a highly decision making position as a career
                switcher. <br />To overcome this issue in the past, I volunteer
                to help out with tasks that excite me even though they were
                clearly outside my responsibilities. This strategy has paid-off
                in many instances and landed me in not so ideal situations. I
                have learnt from them and know what I need to look out for and
                what to stay away from in the future.

                As an ecommerce manager in my most recent role my
                responsibilities were spread wide. I have found resistance from
                team leaders to implement new processes for various tasks.
                <br />I tried to discuss the issues with them so they can see
                the bigger picture in implementing new processes. My primary
                task would be to get team leaders on board, educate them around
                reasons for change and lastly to provide enough training for
                them to implement the changes within their teams. <br />In
                future my goal would be to follow up on their implementation
                progress more closely.
