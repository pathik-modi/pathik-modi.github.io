          <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
          <h3>were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>what was the problem?</p>
              <p>
                For loops have been confusing and scary for me ever since the
                javascript café challenge. Think of for loops like instructions
                for the computer to do a specific task multiple times. Imagine
                you have 100 boxes and you want to find the box which has your
                laptop. For loops are instructions for the computer to look at
                all of those boxes and check for the laptop. So since I was not
                comfortable with using them until now I have been avoiding to
                use them whenever I can.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>
              <p>
                I researched the syntax and understood how it works. I ended up
                thinking lets break down what I’m asked to do. I wrote down the
                code to do the process for one single item. Using the above
                example I wrote down the code to check one box for the missing
                laptop. Then slowly introduced other steps like letting the
                computer know there are 100 boxes, and then letting it know to
                check box 1 then box 2 then box 3 so on and so forth until it
                reaches box 100.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>how did you feel throughout the process?</p>
              <p>
                Felt frustrated initially knowing that for loops are essential
                building block for JavaScript and that I was not comfortable
                with them. Once I broke down the process I felt like I knew what
                was going on in the background for the for loops.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>what did you learn?</p>
              <p>
                The learning process introduced back in the initial sprints was
                actually exactly what I need to be doing when stuck on an issue.
                Writing down comments has helped as well to break down complex
                issues. It creates a roadmap in simple words how to solve the
                issue.

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>what was the problem?</p>
              <p>
                I got to the gradebook challenge and having to learn minor
                details on how to add thing sto objects, removing them from the
                object. Pulling items from another array to bring them to the
                object. Seemed very complex at first sight.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</p>
              <p>
                Knowing to solve a single part of the puzzle at a time I started
                hardcoding one piece of the puzzle then rewriting the next level
                of complexity. Doing this really helped me shorten the code
                which was maybe 10 lines or so down to just 2 lines. This new
                code was not only short but could handle future changes to the
                initial dataset.

            <li>
              <p>how did you feel throughout the process?</p>
              <p>
                Felt very good and could instantly feel that I was getting
                better and more familiar to do things with different data types.
                Felt like I can now take on more complex issues and ready for
                the next level.
              </p>
            </li>

            <li>
              <p>what did you learn?</p>
              <p>
                I learnt that its best to stick to the learning process
                mentioned in the first few sprints. To break down a problem into
                smaller manageable portions and then try to solve those first.

            Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these
            problem-solving techniques/processes:
          </h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Pseudocode – very confident, now that I have used these
                throughout the challenge. Writing comments, writing a hardcoded
                version of the smaller issue then using that as a starting point
                to make it more flexible.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Rubber ducky method – used this method in the for of comments to
                write down what the issue is and how I might be able to
                navigate. Get an overall map of the process was good too
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Reading error messages – feeling like I know much more than
                before. In saying that I have come across situations when I
                wrote something that was just wrong and the error message went
                kdsvjbl aos;dpjv. In those situations I just went back to the
                previous step and tried again to get back on track and get a
                readable error message. The error messages did help with
                figuring out what is expected of the code and what my code was
                returning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Console.logging – this one has been an absolute saviour in the
                later challenges. Used this after I wrote literally every single
                line.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Googling – helps to see different articles on the subject to
                find one that clicks. MDN documents are good but feel like they
                are slightly too in depth. So will read those but also
                supplement other materials for learning.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Asking your peers for help – helped a lot actually. Looked and
                asked for some people in my homegroup for help. Helped out a lot
                when I was stuck on something to get a very overall look at
                where I am stuck not just the written code solution.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Asking coaches for help – coaches are really good. I read the
                threads and from what I have seen they have managed to solve
                every single issue anyone has come up with.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Improving your process with reflection – reflection is a good
                reassurance method of what I know. Majority of times it makes me
                feel good about something and reassures me that I have learnt
                the stuff and am on the home-stretch.
              </p>

            Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what
            made you reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next
            time?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In this sprint I have been stuck on multiple occasions when I didn’t
            really ask for help from peers. My main system is I try to google
            the issue. If no luck, I take a little break and come back to take
            another stab. If still no luck, I check if I am going over the
            timebox suggested time, if I am within the limit I try to take my
            time to understand the topics in further depth. If still no luck, I
            test out a bunch of different things, even if they seem silly and
            not correct I still try. After doing all these I’ve managed to solve
            my issues myself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mostly I do this because I want to understand the concepts and get
            familiar with the syntax and when to use them, I do want to do that
            trial and error myself rather than asking for help to point in the
            right direction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Biggest factor is how much time I have spent being stuck and how
            much time I have left according to the timebox suggestion. If I feel
            like I’m falling behind – I’ll reach out for help.
