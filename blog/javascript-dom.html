          <h3>JavaScript and its relation to HTML & CSS</h3>
          <p>
            JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. It is
            known to be the programming language of the web. That means any
            website you see to this day would have some JavaScript coding done
            to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with JavaScript you are bound to find varying degrees of HTML
            & CSS on any website. Think of HTML as bones and flesh of any
            website. It is the fundamental block of the website where all the
            content needs to start from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of CSS as the skin, the colour of their eyes, their hair etc.
            Everything to do with the visual presentation of the person
            including where the eyes go and the hair goes etc. So it is
            responsible to make the content look appealing, logical and
            understandable.
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript is widely known to be the language of the web. It is all
            the cool things that a person can do and interact with others. Like
            speaking, dancing, jumping running etc. Its where things come
            together.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we were to get slightly technical, think of when you are on
            Youtube and your cursor hovers over a video and how it starts
            playing a short snippet of it in that same spot. JavaScript is
            responsible for making that happen, along with other things ofcourse
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Control Flow</h3>
          <p>
            It is one of the fundamental concepts of JavaScript. Control flow is
            the order in which the computer executes your javaScript code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it as a set of mental checklist you go through while doing
            anything. When a computer looks at statements of a script
            (JavaScript codes) control flow is what helps to decide what to do
            next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Think of it as a checklist you go through for making any big
            decisions in life- like ordering uber eats?
          </p>
          <p>
            Like the below image you start with wondering if you are hungry? If
            it is a yes you go ahead, if it is a no you do not order uber eats.
            So on and so forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            With JavaScript you can apply similar logics for the computer so
            they can make decision for what statement to execute next.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
            src="../img/uber-eats.png"
            alt="Uber eats example"
            width="666.67"
            height="446.67"
          /><br />
          <br />

          <h3>Loops Arrays and objects</h3>
          <p>
            Loops are statements of conditions that help computer decide the
            control flow of statements. They allow to perform the computer to
            perform repetitive tasks. Basically helps to write les code for the
            same things over and over again and put conditions on where to start
            from, when to stop, what do in one loop and what to do after doing
            one loop. They can be for loop, do/while loop, for ..in, forâ€¦of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each of these are made for specific purposes to use them for going
            through an array or object and make changes as needed. Keep reding
            to find out what are arrays and objects.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Arrays and objects</h3>
          <p>
            Objects are a non-primitive datatypes. In simple terms it is a
            container which holds multiple and complex data like a number,
            string and boolean values (true or false). It can be an array, a
            function or an object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arrays are a list of different values stored together is an array.
            See below example and syntax of how to make an array and how you can
            call an array. <br />let array = ["Pathik", 1, "Pathik One", true,
            false] <br />console.log(array[0]) -
            <i
              >this will display "Pathik" as arrays are 0 indexed, which means
              they start counting from 0.</i
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            See below example and syntax of how to make an object and howthey
            can be called <br />
            let object = { <br />name: Pathik, <br />age: 28, <br />fast: true,
            <br />} <br />console.log(object.name) -
            <i>this will display "Pathik"</i>
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions are a hug part of JavaScript. They are a type of
            non-premitive data type or building blocks to hold hold multiple and
            complex data.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main difference with objects and functions is that we can call
            or invoke a function. In very simple terms functions helps us make
            the code smaller. It is a set of instructions in the form of
            statements that are stored together in a function. So you can reuse
            them by invoking or calling them in future.
          </p>
          <p>
            See below example for a function that multiplies one number to
            another number. <br />function multiply (num1, num2) {
            <br />alert(num1 * num2); <br />}
          </p>
          <p>
            You can call this function anytime you want to multiply two numbers:
            <br />
            multiply(10, 5) -
            <i>this will directly multiply 10 to 5 and give back 50.</i>
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>DOM & DevTools</h3>
          <p>Dev Tools</p>
          <p>
            DevTools are the bread butter for developing a web application.
            Developing front end of a web app is made much easier using dev
            tools. It so you do not have to go back and forth between your VS
            code editor to make a small change in your web app only to find out
            it did not work properly. You can test minor changes and adjust
            directly on your browser using dev tools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Different browsers have different dev tools but they are meant to
            perform a similar fundamental task. To show us web developers the
            HTML, CSS and JavaScript among other things. It shows us behind the
            scenes of what makes a web app and with these tools you can
            manipulate these elements and test them out for yourself. You can do
            this for any website- find out the internals of a website and learn
            more about what makes them work. This is what makes it amazing!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>DOM aka Document Object Model</p>
          <p>
            DOM is what holds and binds the HTML, CSS and JavaScript together.
            It is an object representation of your entire HTML document.
          </p>
          <p>
            In simple terms DOM is a detailed index page of a very complex book.
            This index page is holding information of ever single heading,
            paragraph, image, page number all the way down to every single comma
            or exclamation point. It has specific names for these data
            (paragraphs, images etc).
          </p>
          <p>
            JavaScript uses the indexing style syntax called the DOM to access
            elements of the HTML document and do all the cool things with them.
