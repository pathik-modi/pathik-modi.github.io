              Using the journal findings and the high-level overview of the core
              learnings covered in the foundations. Here are my reflections on
              the journey so far.

          <h3>
            What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your
            ego due to the core learning?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Something I had learnt about myself reflecting on the very early
            part of introducing myself and my values is that my background and
            past experiences in my family and environment have such a huge
            impact on my day to day. Learning more about my strengths and
            weaknesses has made me want to double down on my skills and want to
            work on my weaknesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall it has been very helpful to reflect on my thoughts during
            each sprint. Putting them in words through daily journaling gives me
            time to really think about what I have done for the day and sets me
            in the right frame of mind for the next steps.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning
            and programming?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Values we hold close influence our day to day decisions and even in
            what we do. They are very important to understand what motivates
            someone for their actions. Empathy and self-awareness help connect
            and communicate with others and build meaningful relationships. They
            play a huge role in building trust with others including colleagues
            who we will be working with on different projects. As we have learnt
            already EQ plays a huge part not only understanding but also
            influencing people towards a common goal.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            With so much emphasis on IQ specially in a technical field like
            software development EQ is often overlooked. It has that perception
            that you either have high EQ or you don’t. But like many other
            skills it is definitely something you can get better in with
            deliberate, consistent and conscious efforts.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
          <p>
            Sharing personal stories with the team has been the most challenging
            aspect of the core learnings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making sure to carve out time and prioritising mental fitness and
            wellbeing has been difficult at times too.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
            focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think Dev academy’s focus IQ & EQ differentiates the graduates
            from other bootcamps.
          </p>
          <p>"Hire for fit coach for skills"</p>
          <p>
            This is something I have learnt after 2-3 years managing my own team
            – someone who has good communication, fits the cultural requirements
            for the team & has high EQ will always outperform someone who has
            high IQ but very low EQ.
          </p>
          <br />

          <h3>
            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
            programming instead? Justify your answer.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Definitely don’t think it has been a waste of time so far and am
            looking forward to how being in the bootcamp will further my EQ
            working in a team environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            So far I think we have been in an exploration phase learning more
            about ourselves, more about the importance of the core skills we
            need and getting a good foundation and mindset for more.
