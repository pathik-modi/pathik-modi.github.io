              Te Whare Tapa Whā is a model of the 4 dimensions of wellbeing
              developed by Tā Mason Durie in 1984 to provide a Māori perspective
              on health.
              <br />By nourishing and strnegthning all 5 dimensions, you support
              your health and wellbeing, as well as the health and wellbeing of
              your whānau
            </h3>

          <h3>The four dimensions are:</h3>
          <p>
            taha tinana (physical wellbeing)
            <br />taha hinengaro (emotional mental wellbeing) <br />taha wairua
            (spiritual wellbeing) <br />taha whānau (family wellbeing)
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>My Wellbeing Plan</h3>
          <br />
          <h3>Taha tinana (physical wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            It is about how your body grows, feels and moves, and how you care
            for it. <br />To strengthen the physical wellbeing dimension I
            intend to be regular at the gym 3 times a week as per m programme. I
            also would be doing another physical activity like play tennis or
            golf or surf over the weekend. Additionally I’d maintain a good
            sleeping schedule.
          </p>

          <h3>Taha hinengaro (emotional mental wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            It’s about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think.
            <br />I’d take consistent breaks during studying. Communicating with
            others about how I feel more often and prioritizing that more often.
          </p>

          <h3>Taha wairua (spiritual wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            Listen to podcasts about philosophy, connect with the community in
            my local area and spend a minute each day praying.
          </p>

          <h3>Taha whānau (family wellbeing)</h3>
          <p>
            It is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you care about
            and who you share your life with. Making sure to have dinner with my
            partner. Visit my parents once a week for dinner or lunch or a day
            out.
          </p>

          <h3>Whenua (land)</h3>
          <p>
            With 4 walls, the wharenui (meeting house) is a symbol of these 4
            dimensions. The wharenui’s connection with the whenua (land) forms
            the foundation for the other 4 dimensions. <br />Spend 5 minutes
            each morning to have coffee on the deck, take a break from the phone
            to enjoy the garden and take in the morning sun.
